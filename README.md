# Email-Newsletter


## About the project

This email newsletter was designed and built collaboratively by Amy McGowan and Andrea Martz.  The project was completed in response to an assignment during Cohort 4 of Moms Can Code School (https://www.momscan.co/) to create an email newsletter. 

Our newsletter was designed for a fictional community food pantry.  The purpose of the newsletter is to engage community members and show them the ways that they can make a difference for their neighbors in need.
